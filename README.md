<h1 align="center">PONG GAME</h1>

### The classic game made with Python's turtle module.
* At the beginning, you are required to enter the number of rounds you want to play.
  It must be a positive integer.
* To move the right paddle up and down, use arrow keys.
* To move the left paddle up and down, use `W` and `S` keys respectively. No case-sensitivity.
* The ball will speed up whenever it bounces from any paddle, be patient.
* Press `Space` to pause the game, and to continue, press that key again.
* After the game is over, press `Enter` if you wish to restart the game and play one more time.
* **Important**: If you want to quit the game, but you get stuck at the pop-up window 
  asking for the number of rounds, don't freak out, just click `Cancel`.
